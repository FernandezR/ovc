Rev.A FIXME list
================
* U8 part number is incorrect. It should be SN74AXC4T245PWR
* need 30 ohm resistors on SD/MMC card bus lines
* might need 10k pullup (?) on SD_MMC_DAT3
* alternatively, use level-shifter IC for buffering all those lines
* power LED is too bright
* add diode or ideal-diode setup so that DC power + USB-C don't conflict
